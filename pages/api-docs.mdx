### Request Body Description
- `metrics` (array, optional): An array of objects representing the metrics to be calculated for the data.
  - `field` (string, required): The field on which the metric will be applied.
  - `aggregate_operator` (string, optional): The aggregation operator to be used for the metric. Accepted Values:
    - `sum` - Calculate the sum of the values in the field.
    - `avg` - Calculate the average of the values in the field.
    - `count` - Count the number of values in the field.
    - `max` - Find the maximum value in the field.
    - `min` - Find the minimum value in the field.
  - `name` (string, optional): Name you want to be given to this metric.

- `dimensions` (array, optional): An array of objects representing the dimensions to group the data by.
  - `field` (string, required): The field on which the grouping will be performed.
  - `transformations` (string, optional): The transformation to be applied to the dimension. Use this to transform the column:
    - `month` - Convert the datetime field to month.
    - `year` - Convert the datetime field to year.
  - `name` (string, optional): Name you want to be given to this Dimension.

- `filters` (array, optional): An array of objects representing the filters to apply on the data.
  - `dimension` (object, required): The dimension to which the filter will be applied.
    - same as dimension object
  - `filter_operator` (string, required): The filter operator. Accepted values : 
    - `<`
    - `=` 
    - `>`
  - `filter_value` (string, required): The value to be used for filtering.

        "SUM(orders.total)"
    ],
    "data": [
        [
            "Doohickey",
            "6",

    ]
}
```

### Response Description
- `attributes` (array): An array of Attributes representing the name of the dimensions & metrics.
- `data` (array): An array of arrays representing the retrieved data.
  - Each inner array contains the data for one data point.
  - The order of elements in the inner array corresponds to the order of dimensions and metrics specified in the request.
  - Example: The first inner array `[ "1577.4069957733154", "Doohickey", "6" ]` corresponds to the following data points:
    - Metric 1: "1577.4069957733154" (orders.total)
    - Dimension 1: "Doohickey" (products.category)
    - Dimension 2: "6" (orders.created_at, transformed to month)
