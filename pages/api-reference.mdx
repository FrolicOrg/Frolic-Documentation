## Data API

Frolic provides a single API endpoint at `/api` to query data through a `POST` request.

An API request has three main parameters: `metrics`, `dimensions`, and `filters` explained below:

```json
{
    "metrics": [
        // Metrics to be fetched from the database
    ],
    "dimensions": [
        // The category by which metrics should be categorized
    ],
    "filters": [
        // Filters to be applied while fetching data
    ],
    "orderby": [
        // The columns on which data needs to be ordered
    ],
    "limit":[
        //Limit the number of rows that needs to be extracted
    ]
}
```

### Request Body Parameters

- `metrics` (array, optional): An array of objects representing the metrics to be calculated for the data.
  - `field` (string, required): The field on which the metric will be applied.
  - `aggregate_operator` (string, optional): The aggregation operator to be used for the metric. Accepted Values:
    - `sum` - Calculate the sum of the values in the field.
    - `avg` - Calculate the average of the values in the field.
    - `count` - Count the number of values in the field.
    - `max` - Find the maximum value in the field.
    - `min` - Find the minimum value in the field.
  - `name` (string, optional): Name you want to be given to this metric.

- `dimensions` (array, optional): An array of objects representing the dimensions to group the data by.
  - `field` (string, required): The field on which the grouping will be performed.
  - `transformation` (string, optional): The transformation to be applied to the dimension. Use this to transform the column:
    - `month` - Convert the datetime field to month.
    - `year` - Convert the datetime field to year.
  - `name` (string, optional): Name you want to be given to this Dimension.

- `filters` (array, optional): An array of objects representing the filters to apply on the data.
  - `dimension` (object, required): The dimension to which the filter will be applied.
    - same as dimension object
  - `filter_operator` (string, required): The filter operator. Accepted values : 
    - `<` : Less than
    - `=` : Equals
    - `>` : Greater Than
  - `filter_value` (string, required): The value to be used for filtering.
- `orderby` (object, optional): The column list on which we want the data to be ordered.
    - `field` (array, required) : An array of String representing the column names on which order needs to be applied
    - `order` (string, required) : Accepted value `asc` & `desc`, asc is to give ascending order and desc is to give descending order
- `limit` (integer, optional): This is to limit the number of rows in the output.
### Sample Request

        {
            "field": "orders.total",
            "aggregate_operator": "sum"
        }
    ],
    "dimensions": [
        {
            "field": "products.category"
        },
        {
            "field": "orders.created_at",
            "transformation": "month"
        }
    ],
    "filters": [
        {
            "dimension": {
                "field": "users.state"
            },
            "filter_operator": "=",
            "filter_value": "MN"
        },
        {
            "dimension": {
                "field": "orders.created_at",
                "transformation": "year"
            },
            "filter_operator": ">",
            "filter_value": "2002"
        }
    ]
}'
```

### Sample Response

The response of the API is returned as a list of JSON which contains the values of `dimensions` and `metrics`

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "products.category": "Doohickey",
            "orders.total": "1577.4069957733154",
            "orders.created_at": "6"
        },
        {
            "orders.total": "840.4181995391846",
            "orders.created_at": "4",
            "products.category": "Widget"
