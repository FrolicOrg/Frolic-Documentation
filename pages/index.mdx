# Introduction
 
Frolic is a fast and performance backend infrastructure to create customer facing dashboards. It provides ready made API endpoints which can be used to query data directly from the front end. This removes the need to write multiple APIs for different dashboard components and their database queries.

You can also use [frolic-react](https://github.com/frolicorg/frolic-react) along with frolic for your dashboard UI components along to create full stack dashboards much faster.

## Architecture

Frolic acts as the backend infrasctructure for your dashboard helping you query data much faster and easier in the front end.

![Frolic Architecture](/frolic-architecture.png)

Frolic provides single endpoint to query data using simple JSON queries. For example you can use the following request to query the data.

```curl
curl --location 'http://localhost/api' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
      "metrics": [
        {
          "field": "products.price",
          "aggregate_operator": "sum"
        }
      ],
      "dimensions": [
        {
          "field": "products.category"
        }
      ]
}
'
```

Frolic's query engine converts the above request to the database query and executes it. The response of the above query is returned as follows:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "products.price": "51",
            "products.category": "Gizmo"
        },
        {
            "products.category": "Doohickey",
            "products.price": "42"
        },
        {
            "products.category": "Gadget",
            "products.price": "53"
        },
        {
            "products.category": "Widget",
            "products.price": "54"
        }
    ]
}
```
