# Introduction
 
Welcome to Frolic! Glad to see your interest in knowing more about Frolic :)

## What is Frolic?

Frolic is an open source backend service (written in **Rust**) to build customer facing dashboards 10x faster. You can directly connect your database to the project and use ready made APIs to query data and create customer facing dashboards. You no longer have to write custom APIs for different dashboard components and create/maintain SQL queries for them.

You can also use [frolic-react](https://github.com/frolicorg/frolic-react) for your UI along with frolic to create full stack dashboards much faster.
