Follow these steps to set up your database schema for the project:

## Step 1: Connect your Database

Before setting up the database schema, make sure you have connected your database to the project. If you haven't done this yet, please refer to the [Connect your Database](/getting-started/connect-database) document for instructions on how to do it.

## Step 2: Create a relationship file

Inside the `data` folder of your project, create a new file to establish relationships between tables in your database. This file will define how different tables in the database are related to each other. Ensure you provide meaningful relationships to maintain data integrity and facilitate efficient querying.

Example relationship file (`relationships.json`):
```json
{
  "relationships": [
    {
        "parent_table": "orders",
        "child_table": "users",
        "parent_column": "user_id",
        "child_column": "id"
    },
    {
        "parent_table": "users",
        "child_table": "orders",
        "parent_column": "id",
        "child_column": "user_id"
    }
    // Add more relationships as needed
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Run the project and API Endpoint

Once you have set up the relationship file, run the project. Make sure your database connection is active.

Then, access the following API endpoint using your preferred API client or web browser:

**API Endpoint:** `GET - http://localhost:8080/fetch_schema`

This API endpoint will fetch the schema and create a file inside the `data` folder based on the database schema and relationship file you provided.

## Step 4: Restart the project

After running the API endpoint and the file has been created, restart your project. This step ensures that any changes to the database schema and relationships are properly integrated into the project.

Now, your database schema is set up, and you can start running queries on your database using the relationships you defined. Happy querying!
