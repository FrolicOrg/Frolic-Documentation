# App Configurations

Frolic backend service can be configured to suit your requirements by updating the following configurations:


## Database

To connect Forlic to your database enter your database credentials in `database` section of configuration file:

```
USER= myusername
PASSWORD= mypassword
HOST= localhost
PORT=3306
DBNAME= mydatabase
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and do not share it publicly, as it contains sensitive information like database passwords.

  If you are deploying the application to a production environment, ensure that the `.env` file is properly configured on the server, and access to it is restricted.
</Callout>

### Supported Databases

Frolic currently supports the following databases:

* MySQL

We will be adding support for other databases such as `PostgresSQL` and `MongoDB` soon. Checkout our [future roadmap](/future-roadmap) page for more details.
