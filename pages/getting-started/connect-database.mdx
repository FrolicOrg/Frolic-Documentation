# Connecting Your Own Database

Supported Databases :
 
- **MYSQL**

To connect your own database with the project, you'll need to update the `.env` file in the root directory of the project. The `.env` file contains environment variables that the application uses to access the database. Here are the steps to get your database set up:

## Step 1: Obtain Database Details

First, make sure you have the necessary database details from your hosting provider or local setup. You will need the following information:

- **Database User**: The username used to authenticate with the database.
- **Database Password**: The password for the specified database user.
- **Database Host**: The hostname or IP address of the database server.
- **Database Port**: The port number on which the database server is running.
- **Database Name**: The name of the database you want to connect to.

## Step 2: Create the `.env` file

If you don't already have an `.env` file in the root directory of the project, create one. The `.env` file should be in the following format:

```
MYSQL_USER= myusername
MYSQL_PASSWORD= mypassword
MYSQL_HOST= localhost
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_DBNAME= mydatabase
```

## Step 3: Update the `.env` File

Open the `.env` file in a text editor, and replace the placeholder values with the actual database details you obtained in Step 1. Save the changes to the file.

## Step 4: Save and Restart the Application

Save the `.env` file, and then restart your application. The application will now use the new database details specified in the `.env` file to connect to your database.

## Note

- Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and do not share it publicly, as it contains sensitive information like database passwords.
- If you are deploying the application to a production environment, ensure that the `.env` file is properly configured on the server, and access to it is restricted.

That's it! Your project should now be connected to your own database using the details you provided in the `.env` file. If you encounter any issues, double-check the database details in the `.env` file, and make sure your database server is accessible.
