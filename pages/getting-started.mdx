# Getting Started

## Step 1: Setup Your Database Connection

Clone the Repository [https://github.com/FrolicOrg/Frolic]

Now, you'll need to establish a connection to your database. We have a comprehensive guide to assist you in this process. Please refer to our [Database Connection Guide](/getting-started/connect-database) to get your database configured properly.

## Step 2: Setup Your Database Schema

Once your database connection is established, you need to set up the database schema. This step is crucial to ensure that the project functions correctly. For detailed instructions on setting up the database schema, check out our [Database Schema Setup Guide](/getting-started/schema-database).

## Step 3: Setup the Project in Your Local Environment

To set up the project in your local environment : 

1. Use docker to run the database
```
docker-compose up --build
```

You can start using the docker container path to query your data.


## Step 4: Write Your First Query

Now that your project and database are set up, it's time to write your first query! Familiarize yourself with our API documentation, which will guide you on how to interact with the project's features and functionalities. You can find the API documentation at [API Documentation](/api-docs).

Congratulations! You've completed all the initial steps, and now you're ready to start building your awesome project using our platform. If you have any questions or run into any issues, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team or community for assistance.
